    <h2> About Me </h2>
        <dd> Hi, I’m Abdulhameed Abdulhameed, a Computer Science undergraduate at The University of 
            Texas at Dallas, with an Associate of Science degree from Austin Community College. With 
            a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, C++, and Java, I’m passionate about 
            developing innovative solutions through software design and problem-solving.
            Beyond academics, I bring teamwork and leadership skills from experiences such as refereeing 
            for the US Soccer Federation and volunteering with Revitelize LLC, where I enhanced operational 
            workflows and supported educational programs. I’m also an active member of the National Society 
            of Black Engineers, where I connect with like-minded individuals to grow personally and professionally.     
            Whether it’s coding Java applications to calculate polygon areas or creating customer rewards systems, 
            I enjoy turning complex challenges into opportunities for growth. Feel free to explore my portfolio and 
            reach out—I’d love to collaborate on meaningful projects! </dd>
